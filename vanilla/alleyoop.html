  Fontconfig configuration is done via /etc/fonts/conf.avail and conf.d.
  Read /etc/fonts/conf.d/README for more information.

  Configuration via /etc/fonts/local.conf is still possible,
  but is no longer recommended for options available in conf.avail.

  Main systemwide configuration should be done by symlinks
  (especially for autohinting, sub-pixel and lcdfilter):

  cd /etc/fonts/conf.d
  ln -s ../conf.avail/XX-foo.conf

  Check also https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration
  and https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts.

There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file /etc/gconf/2/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help.
